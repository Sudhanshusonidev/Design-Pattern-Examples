Problem Statement: News Subscription System
Scenario:
A News Agency provides news updates on different topics (Politics, Sports, Technology, etc.).
Users (subscribers) should be able to subscribe or unsubscribe to specific news categories.
Whenever a new update is published in a category, all subscribers of that category should get notified automatically.

This problem can be efficiently solved using the Observer Design Pattern.
