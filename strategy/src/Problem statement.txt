Problem Statement: Payment Processing System
Scenario:
A shopping application needs to process payments using different payment methods such as Credit Card, PayPal, and UPI.
The payment method should be chosen dynamically at runtime based on the userâ€™s selection.
The system should be scalable, allowing the addition of new payment methods without modifying existing code.
